Code created in the SME lecture lecture series. Publishing here as a Github repo so people can easily hack it, and repurpose, change and make it further better.
NOTE: sadly I did not go too much into model initialization in the lecture, but it is quite important for good performance. 
The current code will train and work fine, but its convergence is slower because it starts off in a not great spot in the weight space. 
Your exercise is to how to use  `_init_weights` function. 
Even more the code in this repo is a bit different in how it names and stores the various modules, so it's not possible to directly copy paste this code here. 
My current plan is to publish a supplementary code and cover these parts, then I will also push the exact code changes to this repo. 
For now I'm keeping it as is so it is almost exactly what we actually covered in the lecture.
